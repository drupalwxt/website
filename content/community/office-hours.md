Starting in April the Drupal WxT working group will be hosting office hours on a weekly basis to provide assistance for how to use the Drupal WxT distribution. It is important to note that these office hours are done on a best effort basis and only an hour will be allocated for each session with no exceptions.

The Chat Room can be accessed at the following url: <a href="http://gitter.im/wet-boew/wet-boew-drupal">gitter.im/wet-boew/wet-boew-drupal</a>
