## Vision Statement

The Drupal WxT distribution is a web content management system which assists in building and maintaining innovative Web sites that are accessible, usable, and interoperable. The primary goal of Drupal WxT is to provide an enterprise level platform that can assist governments and larger organizations in disseminating data.

## Mandatory Features

There are a lot of features inherently provided by Drupal WxT. However there are a few that have been designated as mandatory to support and as such have shaped the architecture of the distribution.

These features are discussed the table below:
